# Claude Code Instructions

## Production Workflow Requirements

**CRITICAL**: When working on production code, ALWAYS commit changes immediately after implementing any fix. This allows for reliable testing of each individual change.

- Commit after every bug fix
- Commit after every feature implementation  
- Commit after every code change that needs testing
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was fixed/changed

This is essential for production testing workflow and must never be skipped.
